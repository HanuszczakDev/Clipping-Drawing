Project created for the Udacity nanodegree Android Kotlin Developer program.

### Reduce overdraw

"An app may draw the same pixel more than once within a single frame, an event called overdraw. Overdraw is usually unnecessary, and best eliminated. It manifests itself as a performance problem by wasting GPU time to render pixels that don't contribute to what the user sees on the screen."
